In this three part tutorial, I cover matrix "transformations" using p5.js. In this video, I look a bit behind the scenes on how transformations work and where the terms "push" and "pop" come from.  I discuss the difference between a stack and a queue, rotate() vs rotateZ(), and what a "matrix" refers to in computer graphics.
